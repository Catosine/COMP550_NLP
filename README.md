# COMP550_19Fall
This is a repository for [COMP 550: Natural Language Processing](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/comp-550) provied by McGill University in fall 2019.

# Projects
- [**Sentiment_Analysis**](https://github.com/Catosine/COMP550_NLP/tree/master/Sentiment_Analysis)  
This is the folder for the third question of the first assignment. I 
planned to implement a sentiment analysis model using naive bayes, 
logistic regression, and support vector machine to classify a binary 
distributed dataset (either positive or negative). The dataset is the 
same one used in [_Seeing starts: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment 
categorization with respect to rating scale_](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/pang-lee-stars.pdf) 
by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee in 2005. You may access the data from [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/).

- [Decipherment_with_HMM]()  
This is the folder for the third question of the second assignment. I 
planned to implement a standard hidden Markov model to solve a sets of 
ciphers encrypted in three different ways. The dataset is retrived from
professor, which may not be able to be uploaded here.
